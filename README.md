1. **Revenue per State**: A map visualization showing the revenue distribution across different states in the USA.
2. **Revenue per Month**: A line chart displaying monthly revenue trends throughout the year.
3. **Revenue per Age**: A bar chart illustrating revenue generated by different age groups.
4. **Revenue per Category per Gender**: A bar chart showing revenue per category, separated by gender.
5. **Percentage of Revenue per Region**: A pie chart representing the revenue contribution from different regions.
